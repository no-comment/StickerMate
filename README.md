# StickerMates
A small App developed during the hackerthon [hackZurich](https://hackzurich.com) in 2022.

## Short Description
StickerMates is an app that makes meeting new people fun and turns connecting with others into a game. It allows you to collect digital stickers of fellow hackers, colleagues and peers. You can additionally collect event stickers that are available for a limited time. All of these can be stuck on the back of your digital laptop that is on display in your profile for others to admire.

## Why?
Be it hackathons, conferences or other events, you always meet new interesting people. It's always the case that stickers are handed out by companies at these kinds of events: So we thought, why not let people trade theirs too? Since not everyone can or is willing to produce them upfront we set out to digitize this experience. From collecting them to also being able to stick them to the back of your laptop, we tried to recreate the experience digitally to the most minute detail.
